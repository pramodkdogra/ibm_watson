The known benefits of smoking cannabis includes some evidence of potential therapeutic uses for cannabis or its component chemicals (cannabinoids) and many Canadians report using cannabis for medical purposes for health problems such as chronic pain, nausea/vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and spasticity with multiple sclerosis. Any kind of smoke is harmful. In fact, studies have shown that cannabis smoke contains many of the same harmful substances as tobacco smoke. Like smoking cigarettes, smoking cannabis can damage your lungs and can cause bronchitis-like symptoms, coughing and wheezing which can, for example, affect athletic performance.While the effects of second hand smoke from tobacco are well known, more research is needed to better understand the health effects of second hand smoke from cannabis."

THC is an illegal drug with considerable immediate and long-term cognitive side effects. These include impaired thinking and reasoning, a reduced ability to plan and organize, altered decision-making, and reduced control over impulses.Also, chronic use of THC correlates with significant abnormalities in the heart and brain.CBD lacks the harmful cognitive effects of THC. In fact, CBD can counteract the psychoactive effects of THC.Research suggests CBD may be better for inflammation and neuropathic pain, while THC may excel with spasticity and cramp-related pain."
